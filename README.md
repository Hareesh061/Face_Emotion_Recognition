# Face_Emotion_Recognition
This is the basic face emotion recognition project.

about: This Git repository hosts a comprehensive project for Face Emotion Recognition (FER) using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning technologies. The project leverages TensorFlow and Keras as the core libraries for building, training, and deploying the emotion recognition model. Additionally, it utilizes a variety of other Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook, tqdm, and OpenCV-contrib-python, to streamline data processing, visualization, and model evaluation.

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:** The project includes scripts and Jupyter notebooks for collecting and preprocessing the FER dataset. This dataset consists of labeled facial images, each associated with a specific emotion, making it suitable for supervised learning.

**2. Model Architecture:** TensorFlow and Keras are used to define and train a deep neural network for emotion recognition. You will find detailed information about the neural network architecture, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, in the repository.

**3. Training and Evaluation:** Jupyter Notebooks are provided to guide you through the process of training the model on the prepared dataset. Additionally, the repository includes scripts to evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**4. Real-time Emotion Recognition:** One of the highlights of this project is the ability to perform real-time emotion recognition from webcam or image sources using OpenCV-contrib-python. You can use this feature to test the model in a live environment.

**5. Data Visualization:** Pandas and NumPy are employed to visualize and analyze key statistics related to the dataset and the model's performance, making it easy to identify trends and potential areas for improvement.

**6. Progress Tracking:** The tqdm library is integrated to provide a visual progress bar during tasks such as data loading, model training, and testing.
